## Interesting Pieces of Code

### Hibba's Code

One piece of code that I found interesting was within the makePayment method. This piece of code checks to see if the user inputs the correct data type. If they do, the program continues, but if they not, instead of the program crashing, they are asked to try again.

### Alisha's Interesting Piece of Code

If I had to pick a piece of code that I found interesting, I would definitely have to pick where I wrote a  helper method 
which helped me display all the transactions throughout the application without needing to format and print out every time 
I need to show the user their requested transactions.
