## Overview

The Accounting Ledger System is a command-line Java application designed to manage transactions and ledger entries for a small business or personal finance tracking. It allows users to add deposits, make payments, view the ledger, and generate reports based on different criteria such as date range or vendor.

## Features

### Main Menu

#### The Main Menu Screen is where users are prompted to:
- Make a deposit (which is reflected as a credit to their accounts)
- Make a payment (which is reflected as a debit to their accounts)
- View their accounts ledger
- Access and manage their financial goals
- Exit the application

## Interesting Pieces of Code

### Hibba's Code

One piece of code that I found interesting was within the makePayment method. This piece of code checks to see if the user inputs the correct data type. If they do, the program continues, but if they not, instead of the program crashing, they are asked to try again.

### Tristan's Code
One piece of code I found interesting was for my menus. Instead of using nest do while loops with switches I created methods containing the submenus to keep the code more concise and readable.

### Alisha's Interesting Piece of Code

If I had to pick a piece of code that I found interesting, I would definitely have to pick where I wrote a  helper method 
which helped me display all the transactions throughout the application without needing to format and print out every time 
I need to show the user their requested transactions.
